        A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical
        and nursing staff and medical equipment. The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital,
        which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from a broken
        arm to a heart attack. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region,
        with large numbers of beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care.
        Specialised hospitals include trauma centres, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors'
        (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment
        (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories.
        Specialised hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.
